## TODO

### Modules/Learning Materials

- [ ] Modify modules page to have only one module card show up (easiest based and one that user hasnt completed yet)
- [ ] Modules page has a sidebar at the left side that shows the next easiest badge and one they havent gotten yet, then below that badge is a list of badges that also has a sort of easiest to difficult which can be toggled.
- [ ] Below all of that in module page is a big container of module cards with a search bar which can be sorted by difficulty (easiest to hardest or hardest to easiest or recommended)
