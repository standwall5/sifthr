## Assessment Design Framework

### Bloom's Taxonomy Application

Traditional cybersecurity education focuses on **Knowledge** (recall facts) and **Comprehension** (understand concepts). Our assessments target higher cognitive levels:

**Knowledge Level (20% of questions):**

- Recall statistics and definitions
- Identify basic components
- Example: "What percentage of social media users in the Philippines are active on platforms?"

**Comprehension Level (30% of questions):**

- Explain concepts in own words
- Interpret data and trends
- Example: "Why do phishing attacks show higher success rates in Q4 annually?"

**Application Level (30% of questions):**

- Apply frameworks to new scenarios
- Use protocols in practical situations
- Example: "Using Three-Source Verification, what is the first step when evaluating a scholarship offer?"

**Analysis Level (20% of questions):**

- Compare and contrast approaches
- Identify underlying patterns
- Example: "Analyzing the email header, which authentication failure indicates spoofing?"

### Scenario-Based Assessment

**Realistic Scenarios:**

- Actual scam templates adapted from NBI case files
- Platform-specific situations (Facebook ad, Instagram DM, email)
- Multi-step decision-making requiring protocol application
- Time-pressure elements reflecting real urgency tactics

**Distractors Design:**

- Plausible incorrect answers that reveal misconceptions
- Options testing common errors in judgment
- Graduated difficulty (easy distractors obvious, hard distractors subtle)

**Sample High-Quality Question:**

```
Question: You receive an email from "scholarship_office@gmail.com" claiming
to be from CHED, offering a full scholarship but requiring a ₱2,500 processing
fee within 24 hours. Applying the Three-Source Verification method, what is
the MOST effective first step?

A) Directly navigate to the official CHED website (ched.gov.ph) and search
   their scholarship database, ignoring the email entirely ✓
B) Call the phone number provided in the email to verify authenticity
C) Search "CHED scholarship" on Google and click the first result to check
D) Reply to the email asking for verification of their official status

Rationale for Correct Answer: Option A demonstrates proper verification
protocol by using an independent, trusted source (official .gov.ph domain)
rather than any information provided in the potentially malicious email.

Common Misconceptions Tested:
- Option B: Trusting contact information from suspicious source
- Option C: Search engine results can be manipulated via SEO/ads
- Option D: Engaging with scammers provides validation and additional
  information for social engineering
```

### Assessment Validity and Reliability

**Content Validity:**

- Questions directly aligned with learning objectives
- Coverage across all module sections proportional to emphasis

### Passing Criteria Justification

**Threshold: 75-80% depending on module difficulty**

Rationale:

- 100% threshold discourages learning from mistakes
- <70% threshold insufficient for safety-critical content
- 75-80% demonstrates solid comprehension while allowing minor errors
- Aligns with academic grading standards (75% = passing grade in Philippine HEIs)

**Retake Policy:**

- Unlimited attempts with question rotation
- Encourages mastery rather than memorization
- Immediate feedback promotes learning
- No penalties for retakes (gamification encourages engagement)
