# 📝 Markdown Formatting Guide for AdEducate Admins

This guide will help you create beautifully formatted content for learning modules and quiz questions using Markdown.

## 🎯 What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to format text using special characters. It's easy to learn and makes your content look professional!

---

## 📚 Basic Formatting

### **Bold Text**
Make text stand out by wrapping it in double asterisks:
```
**This text will be bold**
```
Result: **This text will be bold**

### *Italic Text*
Make text italic by wrapping it in single asterisks:
```
*This text will be italic*
```
Result: *This text will be italic*

### ***Bold AND Italic***
Combine both with triple asterisks:
```
***This text is bold and italic***
```
Result: ***This text is bold and italic***

### ~~Strikethrough~~
Cross out text with double tildes:
```
~~This text is crossed out~~
```
Result: ~~This text is crossed out~~

## 📋 Headings

Use hashtags to create headings of different sizes:

```
# Heading 1 (Largest)
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6 (Smallest)
```

**💡 Tip:** Use headings to organize your content into clear sections!

---

## 🔢 Lists

### Bullet Points (Unordered Lists)
Create bullet points with hyphens, asterisks, or plus signs:

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item (add 2 spaces before the dash)
  - Another nested item
```

Result:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

### Numbered Lists (Ordered Lists)
Create numbered lists like this:

```
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step (add 3 spaces before the number)
   2. Another sub-step
```

Result:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step
   2. Another sub-step

**💡 Tip:** You can use `1.` for all items and Markdown will auto-number them!

---

## 🔗 Links

Create clickable links:

```
[Click here to learn more](https://example.com)
```

Result: [Click here to learn more](https://example.com)

You can also show the full URL:
```
Visit https://example.com for more info
```

---

## 🖼️ Images

Add images to your content:

```
![Description of image](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

**💡 Tip:** Always upload your image first, then paste the URL!

---

## 💬 Quotes & Callouts

Highlight important information with blockquotes:

```
> **Important:** This is a key point to remember!
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a quote.
```

Result:
> **Important:** This is a key point to remember!
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a quote.

---

## 💻 Code & Technical Terms

### Inline Code
Highlight technical terms or short code with backticks:

```
Use the `click here` button to continue.
```

Result: Use the `click here` button to continue.

### Code Blocks
For longer code examples, use triple backticks:

````
```
function example() {
  return "This is a code block";
}
```
````

## 📊 Tables

Create tables to organize information:

```
| Header 1      | Header 2      | Header 3      |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Row 1, Col 1  | Row 1, Col 2  | Row 1, Col 3  |
| Row 2, Col 1  | Row 2, Col 2  | Row 2, Col 3  |
```

Result:
| Header 1      | Header 2      | Header 3      |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Row 1, Col 1  | Row 1, Col 2  | Row 1, Col 3  |
| Row 2, Col 1  | Row 2, Col 2  | Row 2, Col 3  |

or

```
***
```

## ✅ Real-World Examples for AdEducate

### Example 1: Module Section Content

```markdown
# What is Phishing?

Phishing is a **cybercrime** technique where scammers try to trick you into giving away personal information.

## Common Signs of Phishing

Look out for these warning signs:

1. **Urgent language** - Messages that pressure you to act quickly
2. **Suspicious links** - URLs that don't match the company's official website
3. **Poor grammar** - Legitimate companies usually have professional writing
4. **Requests for personal info** - Banks will *never* ask for passwords via email

> **Remember:** When in doubt, don't click! Contact the company directly using a phone number from their official website.

### How to Protect Yourself

- Never click links in suspicious emails
- Always verify the sender's email address
- Use two-factor authentication when possible
- Keep your software updated

---

*Stay safe online!*
```

### Example 2: Quiz Question

```markdown
## Question: Identifying Phishing Attempts

You receive an email that says:

> "**URGENT:** Your account has been compromised! Click here immediately to verify your identity or your account will be suspended in 24 hours."

Which of the following are red flags in this message? *(Select all that apply)*

**Hint:** Think about the language, urgency, and what the email is asking you to do.
```

### Example 3: Step-by-Step Instructions

```markdown
# How to Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Follow these steps to secure your account:

1. **Open your account settings**
   - Click on your profile icon
   - Select "Security Settings"

2. **Enable 2FA**
   - Find the "Two-Factor Authentication" section
   - Toggle the switch to **ON**

3. **Choose your method**
   - SMS text message
   - Authentication app (more secure!)

4. **Verify your setup**
   - Enter the code sent to your device
   - Save your backup codes in a safe place

✅ **Congratulations!** Your account is now more secure.
