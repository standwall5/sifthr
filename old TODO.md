## TODO

- [ ] Modify admin side too look better
- [ ] Ensure modules take note of rich text (options like what reddit has)
- [ ] Implement the option to change password of user
- [ ] Implement the full translation, even content modules (is that possible? translating dynamic data?)
- [ ] Add a chatbot (utilizing the sifhtr mascot image) that can help users know more about scams or a chatbot they can ask what to do if they are a victim. Basically a chatbot with full information about fake social media advertisements and types of scams. It should be knowledgeable and easy to access.
- [ ] At homepage when logged in, scrolling down reveals sections such as recommended module and then recommended quiz (1 row but they are separated vertically)
  <!-- IGNORE - [ ] Below the recommended module and quiz section in homepage, add a horizontal scroll for badges to earn (sorted by easies to most difficult and maybe even add a toggle for that sort) -->

  at the left side of the screen, add a vertical panel that shows the most recent badge earned and then below that most recent badge are the badges to be earned, which can be scrolled through and is sorted default by easiest to hardest and can be toggled to hardest to easiest.

- [ ] A daily fact about fake social media ads by the sifthr mascot (im only calling it sifhtr mascot so you can find the file easily)
- [ ] Implement a walkthrough of the site using nextstepjs right from the login screen
- [ ] Make sure when using guest, the progress is still saved, just in localStorage.
- [ ] In Quizzes, add a pin game where a user is shown a picture (uploaded by admin) and they click an area of that picture that they think is a sign of a fake ad and if they are correct, a pin will appear, if not, an X will appear instead, indicating they were wrong. Add a counter too for how many fake ads there are
- [ ] Admins can upload a picture of a fake ad (crop it too) and after cropping, they can go press a button like "pin mode" and place pins on the image (which are the correct answers). Since it is almost likely the admin and user will never click on the same exact pixels or x and y points, please just calculate a circle instead so theres still a small approximate area.
